# CASE Mapping Template Python
A template repository for adopters to create CASE mappings utilizing Python.

### Current State
This repository is a basic example that scans a directory for inputs and adds the files within it into a CASE JSON-LD file. This repository can be forked to allow outputs to be converted into the CASE Ontology. The goal is to show two alternative approaches for generating CASE graphs (utilizing serialized Python dictionaries or rdflib) and include validation tools to ensure the output is syntactically correct.
